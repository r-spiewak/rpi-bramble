We used the following materials for our project (this is what we used; feel free to substitute and/or purchase different products from different links; we do not receive profit of any sort from purchases made through these links, so choose products that work best for you):
1. 4 Raspberry Pis. We used whatever Raspberry Pi 4 Model B were available. Specifically:  
   1. 1 Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB RAM  
   2. 3 Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 1GB RAM
2. 4 MicroCenter-brand Micro SD cards
3. 1 [GeeekPi Cluster Stackable Case](https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Cluster-Raspberry-Heatsink-Stackable/dp/B07MW3GM1T/ref=asc_df_B07MW24S61/?tag=&linkCode=df0&hvadid=343224652930&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8717861384181386006&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9007309&hvtargid=pla-782847829850&psc=1&mcid=e2bde0a25c9736469eede4b88c4b03bb&ref=&adgrpid=71764766791&gclid=CjwKCAiA8sauBhB3EiwAruTRJsvVJtcm1vU-5CcHYZK1L-XYRDXNXMBS5bqaVJXWCmo8VKoayOnU3BoCjX8QAvD_BwE&th=1)

6. Extra M3 standoffs (we had leftover from a previous project).
7. 1 [WD 1TB Portable External SSD](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Passport-External-Warranty-WDBAGF0010BBL-WESN/dp/B08F21J716/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?crid=1XYAC2GW3LNSN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WeLfRF17Je8xniwyUAUNdNlqdWnitRFr5GZO68bPCF_Lxf1CDMIraB6FOygWBwzeqYc3qTCWB62wR6OexuOMhNfJiSouKrheh1_hmrRBGIZUFikN9v7HkgAXp4bZk4Vg1tZz4OdOpWjPfuPw_Rh-NCZ7gEaFPU2b5g8fI01yPR4dbmU9FkkEuR6JbrMswwn0xr4-ECz-nhZklhyfazPHvg.xoBoWjNG3uNQzb7Sv_7kwCfgiCPSMaKNpFWHN5mlSQs&dib_tag=se&keywords=wd+ssd+1tb+external&qid=1708101283&sprefix=wd+ssd+1tb+ext%2Caps%2C646&sr=8-5)

Additions (to be added later):
1. Two additional layers for the case (these may be 3D printed?):
   1. One layer to hold the SSD, to go directly underneath the pis.
   2. One layer at the bottom to hold the USB hub, to go under the SSD.

 These two layers should be designed such that the components they hold fit snugly (with maybe a little bit of room so the components have the tiniest bit of wiggle room), and with holes aligned for standoffs between each additional layer and (at least for the one holding the SSD) with the standoffs from the main case.

Optional:
1. A pair of small (jeweler's) needle nose pliars could be useful for screwing in nuts and bolts, and standoffs. We didn't use them, but they would be useful to make sure everything is tight.
